Project coyote

File structure
One instance of jacoco on c drive

- Run of bat files triggered by finished pipeline cmd start http://coyote.lab.local/downloadReports.php?var1=teampath&var2=teamname&var3=reportname&var4=buildno
- triggers download of jar file buildno.jar into Coyote/TestResources/, this then triggers delete all files in c:\jacoco\latest, extract buildno.jar to c:\jacoco\latest. done via resetbaseline and copy custom .bat
- Team report is then downloaded & unzipped to Coyote/teamname/buildno/jacoco.exec, jacoco.exec is then renamed to reportname, overwriting any existing exec for that report and corresponding buildno. The newly named reportname.exec
is copied to Coyote/combined/buildno/ & then all exec in that folder copied to C:\jacoco\dump-out (dump-out should have been cleared by reset baseline bat)
- Finally the report is run, by executing cmd C:\jacoco\apache-ant-1.9.2-bin\bin\ant -Dbasedir="C:\jacoco" -f C:\jacoco\build.xml target - target will be team name and build.xml will be changed accordingly.
- This will result in the report being generated and displayed in C:\jacoco\report\teamname, this team name folder will then be copied to Coyote\Reports\teamname so that it can be diplayed on the site. Number will be updated
automatically for progress bar and report will be available for review if selecting team - get jacoco'd
- At this point reset baseline will be called for a second time and all the exec in Coyote/combined/buildno/*exec will be copied into C:\jacoco\dump-out, the report run and generated under Coyote/report/combined
Hopefully this just overwrites previous combined if not may need to add a clean up step. 

Boom done.
